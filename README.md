ðŸ“š SOLID Principles in C# â€“ Correct vs Incorrect Implementations

This project demonstrates the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design in C# through clear, side-by-side examples.
Each principle is organized into its own folder, containing both Incorrect (violating the principle) and Correct (properly applying the principle) implementations.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each section provides simple, easy-to-understand C# code snippets to help us quickly grasp both the mistakes and best practices when applying SOLID principles.
